    <h1>This Website is about my Favorite things</h1>
    <h2>Bellow I have a list of my favorite things with images to accompany.</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>My favorite thing in school is building electronics such as <a href="https://oscarliang.com/how-to-build-fpv-drone/">drones</a> and planes.</li>
        <li>My second favorite thing is going to <a href="https://eastsideprep.org/">school</a> and meeting my friends</li>
    </ol>

    <p style="width: 800px;">In my free time, I often like building electronics, and making simple and complex circuts with them. Currently, my friends and I are building a 4.5 foot rc plane after school for fun.
        As of my last test, which was in 8th grade, I am currently level 5 in all of the tools in the maker-space such as the vinyl cutter, the laser-cutter, and the 3d-printer. I am also experienced in using a soldering iron,
        and in fact, in the rc plane that I mentioned earlier, my job will be to assemble most of the electronics and the plane body. We estimate that somewhere in the middle of the winter-trimester, we will be finished
        with making our plane, but that is a very rough estimate, because we don't know when we will have time to work on it, so most likely, we will finish before winter-break. Thankfully, the maker-space
        is making our efforts much easier, as we do not have to worry about gathering materials, or on the technology required to shape said materials. Bellow, I have included a video of making an airplane (Boeing 787), 
        which I thought looks very similar to making an rc planem, but on a much larger scale.

    <legend><h2>School:</h2></legend>
    <p style="width: 800px;">Going to school is one of my most favorite things, because without school, I tend to get very bored at home, and want to interact with my friends. </br>
        In school, my favorite place to be is the maker-space, but I do not get much time to go there due to larger amounts of homework.</p>
