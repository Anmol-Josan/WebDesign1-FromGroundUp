<a style="font-family: roboto, sans-serif;font-weight: 400;font-style: normal;">In a paragraph such as this, we would use a lighter font that is easy to read and to understand.
     We typically use Serif fonts for paragraphs because they are easy to read, and they seem far more professional. 
     Sans-serif fonts are usef more for logos or posters because they are for simple and clear messsages. If we wanted 
     to add a quote or some diffrent text, we would use italic text like this <a style="font-family: roboto, sans-serif; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic;">"Fonts are cool and are very useful in text - Anmol 2023"</a>
